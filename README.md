# LQR Implementation and Optimal Control of an Inverted Pendulum
## Overview
This project focuses on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) implementation and optimal control of an inverted pendulum system. The project includes a detailed analysis and simulation of the state-space equations governing the dynamics of an inverted pendulum. It provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and controlling this nonlinear system using LQR, a powerful tool in control theory for designing controllers to operate in uncertain environments.
